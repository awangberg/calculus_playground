messing around with colab activities for calculus

Possible Projects:

1) Estimating Justin Jefferson's Position using a video on Youtube

2) Plotting the position and velocity of a ball dropped in the WSU Atrium

3) Finding the relationship between df and dt for various functions  [ This uses a limiting process by shrinking dt ]

Desmos Notes
-----------------------------
To have Desmos find the coefficients in your model using best-fit:
    1) Create a table in Desmos.  Change the table headings to something appropriate (e.g. x_1, t_1, l_1, or d_x1 or d_f1
    2) Put in a function, like y = b + m x, that models the data. Do NOT use the sliders, and cancel sliders for b and m.
    3) Change the = to a ~ and the variables to use the variables in the table (e.g. p_1 and t_1 instead of x and y)
    4) Desmos gives you the best parameters for b and m.
    5) This works for (any?) model you like.  [ Trig functions might cause problems...]
    
    Possible problems:
    a) A missing value in the table
    b) Dividing by zero causes problems - of course!  Be careful for things like y_1 ~ (1/x_1) sin(x_1) if 0 is one of the x_1 values.
    



Sheet Notes:
-------------

To let students work on a copy of a sheet:

**Change the "edit" to "copy" in the url for the sheet.**

Invite people to make a copy of a file in Docs, Sheets, Slides, or Drawings""
In Google Drive, open the file.
Copy the file link from the address bar.
In Gmail, click Plus Compose​.
Paste the file link in the email and in the link, change edit to copy.
When your email is ready, click Send.
Note: If you haven’t shared the file, you’re prompted to share it now.

When the recipient clicks the link in the message, they’re instructed to click Make a copy.
They can then work on a copy of the original document.
